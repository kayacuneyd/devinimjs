## [Unreleased]

## [0.6.0-beta.0] - 2026-07-24

### Changed

- `constitution.md` adopted **KayaEOS Engineering & Design Constitution v2.0.0** (was 1.0.0):
  deepened the local Product/Design principles into enforceable clauses grounded in the actual
  CKCSS `tokens.css` values (4px-base spacing scale, WCAG contrast test obligations, closed
  radius/shadow/duration/easing sets), added a Fluid Design & Responsive Contract section
  (clamp()-first typography, container-queries-over-media-queries, the existing 640/768/1024px
  breakpoints as the only sanctioned thresholds), and added an AI & Developer Contract section
  (no invented tokens/architecture, self-verification before "done", constitutional-tier files
  require human merge approval). §1–§10 canonical key bindings are unchanged; no prior rule was
  weakened, only made concrete and testable.

### Added

- **Starter kits** (ADR-0020, TASK-020): `create:project --kit=<name>` scaffolds a working
  *page* — several real components composed together — instead of one blank component.
  Pilot kit: `admin-dashboard` (`kits/admin-dashboard/`), a CRUD project list structurally based
  on CKCSS's `data-management.html` pattern, combining `<dv-data-table>` (search/sort/pagination),
  `<dv-modal>` + `<dv-field>` (create flow), `<dv-confirm>` (delete flow) and `<dv-toast-stack>`
  (feedback) through each component's existing documented `data-*`/event contract — no new
  component API. `--kit` and `--format` are mutually exclusive. Verified end-to-end with a real
  Chromium/Playwright pass against the generated output: search/sort/pagination, create→toast,
  delete→toast, Escape-closes-modal, zero console errors, zero axe WCAG A/AA violations, no
  horizontal overflow at 390px/1440px. Auth and marketing-landing kits are deferred follow-ups —
  see `adr/0020-starter-kits.md`.

### Fixed

- **`dist/modules/<name>.js` self-containment** (found while building the kit above, TASK-020):
  14 of 16 components (every one using the i18n or transition primitives, i.e. everything except
  `dv-counter`/`dv-search`) left `../core/i18n.js`, `../core/transition.js` and their own
  `./<name>.locale.js` as unresolved relative imports in `dist/modules/<name>.js` — harmless
  inside this repo's own `dist/` tree, but a 404 the moment the file is copied elsewhere, exactly
  what `create:project` and `docs/guides/starter-kit.md`'s own "copy further `dist/modules/*.js`
  files" guidance both do. Never caught because `npm run verify` doesn't run `npm run build`.
  Fixed in `scripts/build-dist.mjs`: each component's per-module build now bundles those
  relative imports in (esbuild `stdin`/`resolveDir`/`bundle: true`) instead of leaving them
  unresolved, while `dv-data-table`'s one cross-component import (`./dv-pagination.js`) stays
  external/unbundled on purpose — inlining it would make two independently-loaded modules each
  call `define('dv-pagination', …)`, which throws on the second registration. Regression-tested
  in `tests/unit/dist-modules-self-contained.test.js`. `dist/` regenerated; core size gate
  unaffected (`npm run size`: unchanged at 3352 B/4096 B — this only touches per-component
  module files, not `src/core/core.js`).
- `docs/component-manifest.json` (the AI-authoring contract manifest) refreshed against current
  component source — stale since TASK-004 (2026-07-23), never in any single task's file
  ownership so it drifted silently across five rounds. Added: `dv-modal`'s `data-close`;
  `dv-pagination`'s `data-jump-label`, `data-previous-label`, `data-next-label`,
  `data-previous-page-label`, `data-next-page-label`, `data-page-label`, `data-jump-aria-label`,
  `data-go-label`; `dv-confirm`'s `data-confirming-label`; `dv-data-table`'s `data-page-size`,
  `data-filter-label`, `data-pagination-label` and its `dv:filter` event; `dv-cart`'s
  `data-decrease-label`, `data-increase-label`, `data-quantity-label`; `dv-toast-stack`'s
  `data-dismiss`. No source behavior changed — this is a documentation-only sync.

### Added

- i18n/locale primitive wiring for `dv-field`, `dv-state`, `dv-toast-stack` (ADR-0019, TASK-010,
  follow-up to TASK-008): `dv-field`'s `label`/`error`; `dv-state`'s `loading`, `error`,
  `retryLabel`, `empty`; `dv-toast-stack`'s `label` (already routed through `str()`) and a
  previously-hardcoded `aria-label="Dismiss"` dismiss button, each now resolved through
  `t(el, key, fallback)` with its own co-located `*.locale.js` bundle (`en`/`tr`). Deliberately
  **not** wired: `dv-field`'s `id`/`name` (element identity), `control` (selects
  `input`/`textarea`/`select`), `type` (a literal `input[type]` value), `placeholder` (no
  fallback text to wire); `dv-state`'s `state` (selects a render branch) — all configuration, not
  translatable copy, per `docs/guides/i18n.md` §1. Also fixes a pre-existing, never-tested
  `data-retry-label` override bug in `dv-state` (the component called
  `this.str('retry-label', 'Try again')`, a literal kebab-case string passed as a dataset key,
  which `HTMLElement.dataset` never exposes per spec — same class of bug fixed in `dv-confirm`/
  `dv-cart` by TASK-008). `npm run size`: unchanged at `3352 B min+gzip` (both primitives stay
  outside the size-gated core budget). `dv-pagination`/`dv-data-table` (TASK-009) and
  `dv-autocomplete`/`dv-dropdown`/`dv-tabs`/`dv-product-card`/`dv-toast` (TASK-011) were wired in
  parallel by sibling tasks the same round — see `docs/guides/i18n.md` and ADR-0019 for the
  remaining components.
- i18n/locale primitive (ADR-0019, TASK-008, closes a P1 roadmap gap): a new
  `t(el, key, fallback, params)` helper (`src/core/i18n.js`) resolves translatable copy through
  three tiers — an explicit `data-*` override (ADR-0005, unchanged) > the active locale's
  registered bundle entry > the hardcoded fallback — with `{placeholder}` substitution for
  parameterized strings (e.g. a per-row `aria-label`) and `registerLocales()`/`setLocale()`/
  `getLocale()`/`onLocaleChange()` for registering per-component `en`/`tr` bundles and switching
  the active locale at runtime (defaults to reading `document.documentElement.lang`, matching
  `site/en/`/`site/tr/`'s existing convention). Wired into `dv-modal` (`label`, and a
  previously-hardcoded `close` aria-label), `dv-confirm` (`label`, `message`, `confirmLabel`,
  `cancelLabel`, plus a newly-independent `confirmingLabel` for the pending-state group
  aria-label), and `dv-cart` (`empty`, `label`, `removeLabel`, `totalLabel`, plus three
  parameterized per-row aria-labels — `decreaseLabel`, `increaseLabel`, `quantityLabel`), each
  with its own co-located `*.locale.js` bundle file (never a shared/centralized locale file, so
  wiring one more component never touches another's files). Fixes two pre-existing, never-tested
  `data-*` override bugs in `dv-confirm`/`dv-cart` (kebab-case keys passed to `dataset[key]`
  lookups, which only ever resolve as camelCase per spec). Deliberately **not** re-exported from
  `src/core/core.js` — components import it directly, so it stays entirely outside the size-gated
  core budget (`npm run size`: unchanged at `3352 B min+gzip`, confirmed before/after; an in-budget
  `BaseComponent` method was measured and rejected at `+187 B min+gzip` — see ADR-0019). New
  `examples/i18n.html` demonstrates a live `en`/`tr` locale switch across all three components.
  Wiring the remaining ~10 components is deferred to follow-up tasks — see
  `docs/guides/i18n.md` and ADR-0019.
- i18n wiring for `dv-pagination`/`dv-data-table` (ADR-0019, TASK-009): `dv-pagination` gains a
  `dv-pagination.locale.js` bundle covering `label`, `jumpLabel` (both already routed through
  `str()` pre-primitive) plus, newly, `previousLabel`/`nextLabel` (the Previous/Next button text),
  `previousPageLabel`/`nextPageLabel` (their aria-labels), the parameterized `pageLabel`
  (`'Page {page}'`, one per page-number button, substitution verified not to cross-contaminate
  across buttons), the parameterized `jumpAriaLabel` (`'Jump to page, 1 to {pages}'`), and
  `goLabel` (the jump form's submit button text) — none of these were previously routed through
  `str()` at all, having been added directly as template literals before the i18n primitive
  existed. `dv-data-table` gains a `dv-data-table.locale.js` bundle covering `filterLabel`,
  `label`, `paginationLabel` (the last forwarded, already resolved, as the composed
  `<dv-pagination>`'s `data-label` override — verified end to end under a non-English active
  locale, including that an explicit `data-pagination-label` override on `<dv-data-table>` still
  wins through the whole forwarding chain). Fixes two more pre-existing, never-tested `data-*`
  override bugs, same pattern as TASK-008's `dv-confirm`/`dv-cart` fixes:
  `this.str('filter-label', ...)`/`this.str('pagination-label', ...)` passed literal kebab-case
  strings to a `dataset[key]` lookup, which only ever resolves as camelCase per spec — fixed to
  `filterLabel`/`paginationLabel`. `npm run size`: unchanged at `3352 B min+gzip` (both components
  import `t`/`registerLocales`/`onLocaleChange` directly from `src/core/i18n.js`, never through
  `core.js`'s barrel).
- i18n/locale primitive (ADR-0019) wired into `dv-autocomplete` (`label`), `dv-dropdown`
  (`label`), `dv-tabs` (`label`, the tablist's `aria-label` only — its ARIA reference wiring for
  tab activation, keyboard nav and panel/`aria-selected` logic, ADR-0010, is untouched), and
  `dv-product-card` (`action`) (TASK-011), each with its own co-located `*.locale.js` bundle
  file. `dv-product-card`'s `name` fallback (`'Product'`) was deliberately left unwired — it's a
  generic missing-product-data placeholder read once via `initialState()`, not UI chrome copy in
  the same sense as the other wired strings; see `src/components/dv-product-card.locale.js`.
  `dv-toast` was audited and found to have nothing to wire: its one `str()` call (`message`) has
  an empty-string fallback with no hardcoded English default, since the toast always displays
  consumer-supplied text — no `dv-toast.locale.js` was created. `npm run size`: unchanged at
  `3352 B min+gzip`, confirmed before/after.
- Transition/animation primitive (ADR-0018, TASK-007, closes a P1 roadmap gap): a new
  `awaitTransition(el, { timeout })` helper (`src/core/transition.js`) resolves on a real
  `transitionend`/`animationend`, or a 200ms timeout fallback for consumers with no CSS defined
  — so nothing ever hangs. Wired into `dv-modal` (backdrop/dialog exit), `dv-toast` (hide),
  `dv-toast-stack` (per-item dismissal), and `dv-disclosure` (collapse); opening/expanding/
  showing stays instant and unchanged in every case. All existing attributes, `dv:*` event
  names and timing, and `state` shape are unchanged — only the DOM-presence teardown (the
  `hidden` attribute reapplying, or a toast-stack item leaving the list) is deferred behind the
  primitive. `themes/ckcss.css` ships real `opacity`/`transform` exit transitions (keyed off a
  new `data-leaving` attribute) as the reference implementation, plus a
  `prefers-reduced-motion: reduce` override. Deliberately **not** re-exported from
  `src/core/core.js` — components import it directly, so it stays entirely outside the
  size-gated core budget (`npm run size`: unchanged at `3352 B min+gzip`, confirmed
  before/after). `dv-tabs`' panel crossfade is a different problem shape (two always-mounted
  panels, not an open/close pair) and is explicitly deferred to a follow-up task — see
  ADR-0018. See `design/component-library.md`.
- `dv-data-table` gains client-side pagination and filtering (TASK-004, closes a P1 roadmap gap):
  a built-in text filter narrows rows by case-insensitive substring match across every visible
  column and emits `dv:filter` with `{ query }`; a new `data-page-size` attribute (absent or `0`,
  the default, means no pagination — unchanged behavior for existing callers) slices the
  filtered-then-sorted result set and composes the existing `<dv-pagination>` for page controls.
  Changing the sort, the filter, or `data-rows` resets to page 1 so the view never strands past
  the end of a shrunk result set. Sorting is also now numeric-aware when both compared values
  parse as finite numbers (previously always lexicographic — `"10"` sorted before `"2"`
  ascending), falling back to locale-aware text compare otherwise. See
  `design/component-library.md`.
- Starter-kit scaffolding CLI (ADR-0016): `npm run create:project -- <target-dir> [--format=static|php]`
  generates a build-free `dv-counter` starter (static `index.html` or PHP-fed `index.php`) from
  the committed `dist/` artifacts — see `docs/guides/starter-kit.md`.
- Component error boundary (ADR-0015): `onError(error, phase)` lifecycle hook, called when
  `template()` throws during a render or an action method throws during dispatch. Default
  behavior (rethrow) is unchanged for every existing component; overriding it contains the
  error instead. Available in both the `BaseComponent` class API and as `config.onError` in the
  `component()` factory.
- Generated TypeScript declaration files (`types/`), built from the existing JSDoc via a new
  `typescript` devDependency and `npm run build:types` (wired into `npm run build`); see
  ADR-0017. `package.json`'s `types` field and every `exports` entry now resolve to real types —
  `import { BaseComponent } from 'devinimjs'` gets editor/AI-agent autocomplete without any
  runtime dependency or compile step for consumers.
- `dv-pagination`: a page-number list and a jump-to-page control, closing the roadmap P1 gap
  ("Prev/Next only, no page-number list or jump-to-page"). The page list renders every page up
  to 7, then truncates to the first page, the last page, and up to two pages either side of the
  current page with `…` ellipsis markers for gaps (e.g. `1 … 8 9 10 11 12 … 20`). Jump-to-page is
  a `<form>` with a numeric input; submitting it calls the existing `goTo()`, so invalid or
  out-of-range input is clamped exactly like any other navigation and can never crash or emit an
  out-of-range page. `aria-current="page"` now marks the active page-number button (moved off the
  plain status text), and the Previous/Next/jump controls carry explicit `aria-label`s so they're
  distinguishable without relying on visual position. The `data-page`/`data-total`/`data-size`
  attributes and the `dv:page` event contract — which `dv-data-table` composes against — are
  unchanged and additive-only; no new event type was introduced.
- `dv-modal` now implements a real WAI-ARIA APG focus trap (closes `docs/roadmap.md` P1): `Tab`
  from the last focusable element inside the dialog wraps to the first, `Shift+Tab` from the
  first wraps to the last, and focus starting on the dialog wrapper itself is treated as being at
  the wrap point. Nested/overlapping modals (a second `<dv-modal>` opened while another is still
  open) are handled with a small module-level open-modal stack — only the topmost open modal
  traps `Tab`, so a background dialog's key handling can't fight the foreground one; the trap
  reverts to the previous modal automatically once the top one closes. Existing open/close,
  Escape, opener-focus-return, and `data-open` sync behavior is unchanged.

### Fixed

- `dv-field`: the inline validation message used an unquoted `hidden=${…}` attribute, which fell
  outside the `html` tag's boolean-attribute rule (ADR-0002 #5) and produced malformed markup —
  the message never became visible and lost `role="alert"` when a required field was invalid.
  Found while verifying TASK-003's test-depth work; fixed by quoting the attribute.

### Changed

- `dv-cart`'s `remove(id)` action method is renamed to `removeItem(id)` — the old name shadowed
  every custom element's inherited native `Element.prototype.remove()`. The `dv:remove` event
  name is unchanged. Found while verifying TASK-002's type-declarations work (checkJs surfaced
  the shadowing). If you called `cartEl.remove(id)` directly rather than clicking the built-in
  remove button, update the call site.

### Tests

- Deepened unit coverage for `dv-autocomplete`, `dv-data-table`, `dv-dropdown`, `dv-modal`,
  `dv-field`, `dv-toast-stack` and eight further components with edge-case, keyboard and
  cleanup-timing tests (TASK-003; 90 → 137 tests), including a passing test that documents
  `dv-modal`'s known lack of focus-trap cycling (`docs/roadmap.md` P1).

## [0.6.0-beta.0] - 2026-07-22

### Added

- Experimental AI-first `component()` authoring entry (`devinimjs/authoring`) for ordinary,
  build-free `.dv.js` components.
- Typed, live and read-only `data-*` props; compact `state`, `sync`, `actions` and `view`
  contract; concise `on:event="action"` directives with legacy `data-on:event` compatibility.
- `dist/authoring.min.js`, browser-direct example, generator `--format=dv` and
  `npm run validate:component -- tag-name` delivery-contract check.
- English and Turkish AI-first documentation pages, AI reference updates and a live docs demo.

### Changed

- `<dv-counter>` and `<dv-search>` now use the factory API while preserving tags, attributes,
  events and existing consumer behavior.
- `requestUpdate()` avoids adding an extraneous external change marker when state already owns
  the current render batch.

## [0.3.0] - 2026-07-22

### Added

- Atomic components: `<dv-dropdown>`, `<dv-search>` and `<dv-product-card>`.
- Shared cart store example and a live component catalog at `/components/`.

## [0.2.0] - 2026-07-22

### Added

- Keyed morphing (ADR-0014): direct sibling lists whose elements all declare unique `data-key`
  values now retain DOM identity across reorders, insertions and removals. Mixed or invalid keyed
  ranges safely fall back to positional morphing.
- Application helpers: `createAsyncState`, `fetchJson`/`HttpError`, `createForm`, path-filtered
  `useStore`, reconnect-safe store subscriptions, cleanup helpers and `createHashRouter`.
- Components: `<dv-disclosure>`, `<dv-modal>`, `<dv-toast>` and `<dv-pagination>` with unit and
  real-browser E2E coverage.

## [0.1.0] - 2026-07-21

The first public release: a build-free, Proxy-reactive component runtime plus two accessible
components, shipped as plain ES modules for PHP/shared-hosting projects.

### Added

- Core runtime: `createReactive` (Proxy-based deep reactivity), `html` tagged template with
  auto-escaping and boolean-attribute handling, `morph` DOM patcher with `<dv-outlet>` support,
  `BaseComponent` (morph render, event delegation, lifecycle hooks, attribute helpers),
  `define` registry guard, `safeUrl` utility.
- Shared store (ADR-0011): `createStore`, `BaseComponent.useStore()` with auto-unsubscribe,
  and `requestUpdate()` for external data sources.
- Components: `<dv-counter>` (PHP-fed via `data-*`, emits `dv:change`) and `<dv-tabs>`
  (WAI-ARIA APG tabs: roving tabindex, arrow/Home/End keys with wrap-around, automatic
  activation with `focusin` sync, unique per-instance ids; labels from child `data-tab`
  attributes).
- Core: `prepare(fragment)` hook on `BaseComponent` (ADR-0009 amendment; first consumer:
  `<dv-tabs>`).
- Examples: `counter.html`, `counter.php` (PHP-fed) and `tabs.html`.
- Distribution (ADR-0007): committed `dist/` artifacts — `core.js`, `core.min.js`,
  `devinim.min.js`, per-component `dist/modules/`.
- Documentation: architecture, PHP integration guide, component library.
- Decision records: ADR-0001 through ADR-0014 (0012–0014 proposed).
- Tooling: ESLint flat config, 44 unit tests (`node --test` + happy-dom), E2E suite
  (Playwright, real Chromium) with axe-core WCAG A/AA scans (zero violations), size gate
  (core: 2.5 KB min+gzip, budget 4 KB), CI workflow.

### Fixed (caught by the E2E layer)

- Event dispatch no longer relies on dynamic attribute selectors — colon-containing
  `data-on:*` names made them invalid in real browsers (happy-dom had tolerated them).
  Directive resolution now walks up from `event.target` (ADR-0004 amendment).
